## 📋 What is BMI-CALCULATOR?

BMI-CALCULATOR is a simple tool that helps you find out your Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a number that shows if your weight is healthy for your height. This app uses a clean dark theme and works both in metric units (like kilograms and centimeters) and imperial units (like pounds, feet, and inches).

You can use this app to:
- Check your current BMI.
- See which BMI category you belong to (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese).
- Get an easy-to-use interface that works well on any device, large or small.

This tool helps you understand your body weight better without needing a calculator or any math.

## 🖥️ How to Download & Install

To start using BMI-CALCULATOR, you need to get the app files on your computer. The app works directly in a web browser, so you do not need to install any special software.

1. Click the big blue button at the top, or visit this page:  
   [https://github.com/xiaolanniaocm/BMI-CALCULATOR/releases](https://github.com/xiaolanniaocm/BMI-CALCULATOR/releases)

2. On that page, look for the latest release.

3. Download the ZIP file that contains the app files. It should be named something like `BMI-CALCULATOR-x.x.x.zip`.

## 🚀 How to Run the App

You do not need to install anything extra. Just follow these steps:

### Option 1: Open in Your Browser Directly

- In the folder where you extracted the files, find the file named `index.html`.
- Double click `index.html`. It will open in your default web browser.
- You can now use the app right away.

### Option 2: Use a Local Server (Optional for Advanced Users)

If you have Visual Studio Code or another code editor with a local server (for example, "Live Server"), you can use that to serve the files. This helps with some browser restrictions but is not needed for most users.

### Option 3: Use Node.js `serve` Tool (For Comfort)

If you have Node.js installed, open your command prompt or terminal, go to the folder with the files, and run this command:

```
npx serve .
```

Then, open the URL it gives you (usually `http://localhost:5000`) in your browser.

## 📊 Understanding BMI

BMI is a simple way to estimate if your weight is healthy for your height. It uses a formula:

```
BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) × height (m))
```

When you use the app with metric units, it does this calculation for you. If you use imperial units, the app converts your info to metric behind the scenes.

Here are the BMI categories:

| Category    | BMI Range   |
|-------------|-------------|
| Underweight | Less than 18.5  |
| Normal      | 18.5 to 24.9    |
| Overweight  | 25 to 29.9      |
| Obese       | 30 or higher    |

Knowing your BMI helps you understand if you might need to gain or lose weight, but it doesn’t tell you everything about your health. Always ask a doctor for health advice.
